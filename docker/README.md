# ds3-java-docker
A public docker file that has all the dependencies to build and develop the DS3 Java SDK

To use this docker container, run the following command:

`sudo docker run -it spectralogic/ds3_java_docker_test`

This will start the container with an interactive bash shell which will allow you to clone the ds3_java_sdk and then build it.
